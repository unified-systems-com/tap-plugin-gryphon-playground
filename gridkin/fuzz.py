"""Differential property fuzzer for Gryphon — the capstone rung of the ladder.

The model oracle (`req-gridkin-oracle-assertion`, `model_oracle.py`) is a second
Gryphon engine that recomputes a query's answer over plain Python objects with
**zero lowering shared** with the SQL-compiling executor. Gridkin wires it as a
per-scenario differential over the *authored* corpus. This module removes the
"authored" restriction: it is a **seedable generator** that emits a random small
GRIFT graph over the playground types and a random VALID query over the oracle's
modeled surface, runs both engines, and asserts they agree. The oracle IS the
differential harness — only the generator was missing, and this is it.

Load-bearing discipline (the whole guarantee rests on it):

- **Zero shared lowering, still.** The generator and the oracle are authored from
  the language spec / grammar; neither imports a line of `executor.py` ORM
  lowering. Two independent implementations grinding on random input is the
  entire source of the differential signal.
- **Generate WITHIN the modeled surface, skip the rest loudly.** Every query the
  generator emits is well-typed (severity_score/int, is_open/bool,
  kind·name·description/string, observed_at/null-predicates only — matching
  `_declared_data_types` so the type-strictness gate never rejects a generated
  query) and stays inside the shapes the oracle models. If a case still hits
  `OracleUnmodeled` it is recorded as an honest skip, never a fake green. The one
  permanent oracle skip — `LIMIT` without `ORDER BY` — is never generated (LIMIT
  is only emitted alongside an ORDER BY, or as the always-empty `LIMIT 0`).
- **Bind to real data.** Literals are sampled from the values actually present in
  the seeded graph, so filters partition the graph (meaningful differentials)
  rather than trivially returning empty. Nulls are produced deliberately — both
  the 2VL null *literal* operand (`field OP null`, genuine FALSE) and the 3VL
  null *field* (an unobserved `observed_at`, SQL three-valued logic) — because the
  2VL/3VL boundary is where Gryphon's null risk concentrates.
- **Replayable from the seed alone.** All randomness (graph shape, field values,
  entity UUIDs, query shape) flows from one `random.Random(graph_seed)` stream, so
  a divergence prints the seed + the emitted GRIFT + the query + both results and
  is reproducible with nothing but the seed. UUIDs are drawn from the seeded RNG
  (never `uuid4()`), so replay is bit-exact.
- **Production seeding.** The graph is imported through the real `grift_import`
  path with the same error discipline `gridkin/runner.py::_seed_fixture` uses, so
  the fuzzer exercises production seeding, not a test-only shortcut.
