"""Long-running Gryphon fuzz *campaign* — the measurement engine behind the
bug-frequency trend (`scripts/gryphon-fuzz-campaign`).

This is NOT a gate. The per-commit gate is `test_gryphon_fuzz.py`, which asserts
a small committed band agrees and fails on any divergence. This module is its
long-soak complement: it grinds a large, *fresh* seed band (advanced past every
prior campaign so it never re-tests fixed territory — the whole point, since
divergences are deterministic and a fixed seed never re-fires), classifies every
query via `fuzz.run_query` WITHOUT asserting, and writes a machine-readable
campaign summary. The bash orchestrator stamps it with the commit + UTC, appends
it to an append-only JSONL ledger, and prints the trend.

The metric that trends **down-and-to-the-right** as the executor hardens is
*distinct new defects per 100k queries over fresh seed space* — with the
oracle-*asserted fraction* recorded alongside so a falling defect rate cannot be
faked by the generator drifting off the modeled surface (bugs→0 must mean
"hardened", not "stopped exploring"). See `spec-gridkin-v0.md`
(`req-gridkin-fuzz-campaign`) and the Validation Map in `spec-dev-validation.md`.

DB isolation is inherited verbatim from `test_gryphon_fuzz.py`: one
`transaction=True` parametrized item per graph, so each graph seeds a truncated
database (search_readonly shares the physical DB, so seeds must commit to be
visible — the reason rollback isolation will not work here).

Activated only when `GRYPHON_FUZZ_CAMPAIGN_OUT` names a summary path; otherwise
the module is skipped so a normal `pytest` run neither builds a band nor grinds.
Env knobs (all read by the orchestrator):

    GRYPHON_FUZZ_CAMPAIGN_BASE     first seed of the band (orchestrator advances it)
    GRYPHON_FUZZ_CAMPAIGN_GRAPHS   graphs in the band (default 50)
    GRYPHON_FUZZ_CAMPAIGN_QUERIES  queries per graph (default 25)
    GRYPHON_FUZZ_CAMPAIGN_OUT      path to write the summary JSON (required to run)
