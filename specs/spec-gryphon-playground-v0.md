# Gryphon Playground Plugin Specification (v0)

## Philosophy

The `gryphon_playground` plugin is TAP's dedicated environment for exercising and
testing the Gryphon query language. Gryphon is the canonical read path for
TAP-managed graph data — "Gryphon over ORM" is a canonical project rule — and that
load-bearing status makes a first-class place to stress, validate, and demonstrate
the language disproportionately valuable. Real-world use on the Sam-demo critical
path has already surfaced blocking executor bugs and regressions; the playground
exists to turn that class of failure into something a hand-authored test catches
before it ships.

The plugin hosts two things:

1. **The Gridkin scenario corpus** and its backing graph fixtures. Gridkin is the
   scenario-driven test format for Gryphon; the format itself is specified
   separately in the companion [spec-gridkin-v0.md](spec-gridkin-v0.md).
2. **A pytest-discoverable Gridkin runner** that drives the scenarios.

The **graph vocabulary** the fixtures build from — the abstract node types
(`grid_fixtures__node` / `__hub` / `__leaf` / `__cycle_node`) and wildcard edge
types (`PG_LINKS` / `PG_NESTS` / `PG_LOOPS` / `PG_OPTIONAL`) designed *only* to
exercise query patterns (cycles, self-loops, multi-edges, sparse/dense regions,
optional relationships, dimension partitions) — **no longer lives here**. It was
extracted into the neutral [`grid_fixtures`](../../grid_fixtures/README.md) plugin
so it can be shared by the core suites, and `gryphon_playground` now simply
`depends_on` it (see [req-gryphon-playground-scope](#plugin-scope)). This lets the
playground be dropped from any profile without redding the core suites — it is,
literally, a playground.

Keeping the vocabulary decoupled from real domain models (`lotr`, `aws_core`,
`samsite`) means Gridkin scenarios don't accidentally constrain real-world graph
shapes, and real-world graph evolution doesn't accidentally break Gridkin tests.

This spec is the **top-level, governing** specification for the plugin: its
purpose, scope, and the `grid_fixtures` vocabulary it consumes. The Gridkin scenario file format,
runner contract, oracle discipline, snapshot discipline, requirement traceability,
and JSON Schema are specified in [spec-gridkin-v0.md](spec-gridkin-v0.md). Where
the two specs touch the same surface, this spec governs *what the plugin
contains*; the Gridkin spec governs *the format of the files it contains*.

## Relationship to the Gryphon Wishlist

[`doc-dev-gryphon-wishlist.md`](../../../docs/misc/doc-dev-gryphon-wishlist.md) is the
operational companion to this spec and the Gridkin spec — a prioritized,
demand-shaped view of what Gryphon needs to grow into, plus the validation
discipline every Gryphon extension ships under. It is required reading before
extending Gryphon or adding scenarios.

### Plugin Scope
----
RID: `req-gryphon-playground-scope`
Status: `Implemented`

The `gryphon_playground` plugin exists to host Gryphon test scenarios, their
backing graph fixtures, and the runner that drives them. The graph vocabulary the
fixtures build from lives in the `grid_fixtures` plugin, which this plugin
`depends_on`.

#### Implementation

The plugin contains:

- **No node or edge types of its own.** Its fixtures build from the
  `grid_fixtures__*` / `PG_*` vocabulary (see
  [req-gryphon-playground-vocabulary](#playground-node-and-edge-types)), which lives
  in the `grid_fixtures` plugin declared as a `depends_on` in this plugin's
  `tap-plugin.toml`. The Gridkin corpus references those types by string, so
  `grid_fixtures` must be installed + migrated before this plugin loads (the
  pre-boot consistency gate enforces the install order)
- A directory of shape-targeted GRIFT fixtures (`fixtures/<shape>.grift.json`) —
  each fixture seeds one specific graph topology corner
- One canonical multi-shape playground fixture (`fixtures/playground.grift.json`)
  — used for the `gryphon explain` demo surface and as a tutorial graph for the
  language
- A directory of Gridkin scenario files (`scenarios/<feature>.gridkin.json`) —
  each scenario set covers one Gryphon feature
- A directory of expected-envelope and expected-SQL side files (`expected/`)
- A pytest-discoverable Gridkin runner that drives all of the above

The plugin does **not** contain:

- The Gryphon executor, parser, or grammar source — Gridkin tests the executor, it
  does not implement it; that source lives in `tap_grid/gryphon/`
- A collector — the playground graph is seeded from committed GRIFT files, not
  collected
- Pages, panels, searches, layouts, or any user-facing surface — the playground is
  a developer artifact
- Node or edge types — the abstract vocabulary its fixtures use (`grid_fixtures__*`
  / `PG_*`) lives in the `grid_fixtures` plugin, a `depends_on`; this plugin
  registers none of its own

Because its scenarios run under pytest against the `grid_fixtures` vocabulary,
`gryphon_playground` IS installed (editable) + registered in `INSTALLED_APPS` in any
env that runs the Gridkin lane — unlike a standalone-repo plugin awaiting
integration. But it is now a pure **leaf**: nothing outside it imports it, so it can
be dropped from a profile and only the Gridkin lane drops — the core suites stay
green (they reach for `grid_fixtures`, not this plugin). That leaf status is exactly
what the extraction bought.

#### Acceptance Criteria

### Playground Node and Edge Types
----
RID: `req-gryphon-playground-vocabulary`
Status: `Implemented`

Gridkin fixtures use a small, abstract vocabulary of node and edge types that
exist only to exercise query patterns. **This vocabulary lives in the neutral
[`grid_fixtures`](../../grid_fixtures/README.md) plugin** — it was extracted out of
`gryphon_playground` so the core `tap_grid` / `tap_api` suites can build fixtures
from the same neutral types (the role `lotr` also fills), and so this plugin can be
a droppable leaf. `gryphon_playground` declares `grid_fixtures` as a `depends_on`
and its corpus references the types below by string. The description here is the
authoritative scenario-author reference; `grid_fixtures` owns the models.

#### Implementation

Node types (entity-type slug → intended shape):

- `grid_fixtures__node` — generic node, no special semantics; the default building
  block
- `grid_fixtures__hub` — semantically marked as a hub (graph patterns where one node
  has many neighbors)
- `grid_fixtures__leaf` — semantically marked as a leaf (terminal in a chain)
- `grid_fixtures__cycle_node` — used to construct cycles, self-loops, and
  multi-cycles

The semantic distinction between the four types is **convention expressed through
the `entity_type` slug**, not through differing fields — the executor does not
care, but a scenario can target a type to construct an intended shape, and
label / type-scan patterns need distinct labels to match against. (The backing
Python classes retain their origin names `PgNode` / `PgHub` / `PgLeaf` /
`PgCycleNode`; only the entity-type namespace moved from `gryphon_playground__pg_*`
to `grid_fixtures__*`.)

Edge types:

- `PG_LINKS` — generic directional edge
- `PG_NESTS` — used to construct compound / nested graph shapes
- `PG_LOOPS` — used to construct self-loops and small cycles
- `PG_OPTIONAL` — used to construct sparse fan-outs where some nodes have the edge
  and some don't (for `OPTIONAL MATCH` testing once that feature is implemented)

Each edge type's registered slug is namespaced `<TYPE>__grid_fixtures` (e.g.
`PG_LINKS__grid_fixtures`), matching the owning plugin.

Edge types declare **no `sources` / `targets` constraints** (wildcard). Fixtures
must be free to build any topology — self-loops, multi-edges, cross-type links —
without fighting edge-constraint validation.

Naming convention: `grid_fixtures__*` for node types, `PG_*` for edge types. The
`grid_fixtures__` namespace is unambiguous against any real domain plugin (no
production vocabulary uses it), and the edge `PG_` prefix is short enough to read in
queries without noise.

**Field set.** Every playground node model carries an identical typed-field set,
chosen so that fixtures and scenarios can exercise each scalar predicate type the
executor supports. The fields are identical across all four node types so the
predicate surface is uniform regardless of which playground type a scenario
targets.

| Field | Type | Predicate surface exercised |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `description` | text | string predicates; absence (`""`) for blank-field corners |
| `kind` | string | string equality / prefix predicates, categorical filters |
| `severity_score` | integer | numeric comparison predicates, aggregation inputs |
| `is_open` | boolean | boolean predicates |
| `observed_at` | datetime (nullable) | datetime comparison predicates, `IS NULL` corners |
| `tags` | JSON | JSON-key access predicates (`data.tags.<key>`) |

The `name` field (the BaseModel display field) is also present. The exact Python
mechanism for sharing the field set across the four models (repetition vs. an
abstract mixin) is an implementation choice made in the scaffold change, not
fixed here.

#### Acceptance Criteria

| ACID | Title | Status | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| req-gryphon-playground-vocabulary-1 | Decoupled From Domain Vocabulary | Implemented | No fixture node or edge type collides with any production plugin's vocabulary. | `grid_fixtures__*` / `PG_*` namespace (owned by the `grid_fixtures` plugin) |
| req-gryphon-playground-vocabulary-2 | Typed Fields Cover Predicate Surface | Implemented | Playground BaseModels carry typed fields covering each scalar predicate type the executor supports (string, int, bool, datetime, JSON). | |
| req-gryphon-playground-vocabulary-3 | Edge Types Are Wildcard | Implemented | Playground edge types declare no source / target constraints, so fixtures can build any topology. | |
| req-gryphon-playground-vocabulary-4 | Vocabulary Documented Inline | Implemented | The plugin README lists the playground node and edge types and their intended use, so scenario authors don't reinvent. | |

### Two-Tier Fixture Structure
----
RID: `req-gryphon-playground-fixtures`
Status: `In Development`

Fixtures come in two tiers, each serving a distinct role.

#### Implementation

**Tier 1 — shape-targeted fixtures** (`fixtures/<shape>.grift.json`):

Each fixture seeds one graph topology corner in isolation. Initial set (extended
as features land — when a new feature reveals a topology corner no Tier 1 fixture
covers, the same change adds the fixture):

- `cycles.grift.json` — 2-cycle, 3-cycle, self-loop
- `multi_edge.grift.json` — same node pair connected by multiple edges of different types
- `sparse_dense.grift.json` — one densely connected hub, plus isolated islands
- `soft_deletes.grift.json` — mix of live and soft-deleted entities (`deleted_at` not null)
- `polymorphic.grift.json` — multiple node types sharing edge types
- `nesting.grift.json` — parent / child compound structures
- `optional_relations.grift.json` — sparse fan-out: some nodes have the edge, some don't
- `dimensions.grift.json` — entities partitioned across dimension scopes
- `json_payloads.grift.json` — entities with rich JSON-backed `tags` fields

Tier 1 fixtures are loaded individually by individual scenarios — small, focused,
isolated. Each is small enough to read in full (≤ ~100 entities; in practice the
first fixtures are far smaller, because the oracle discipline depends on a human
being able to hand-enumerate the expected result).

**Tier 2 — the canonical playground fixture** (`fixtures/playground.grift.json`):

One larger GRIFT file that combines representative samples from every shape. Its
role is *not* test isolation — it is the demo and tutorial graph. The `gryphon
explain` surface (when built) defaults to loading the playground fixture so a
developer can paste a query and see it run against a known graph. It is also the
recommended graph for ad-hoc exploration in the shell.

Tier 2 has exactly one fixture file. It is **not** used by Gridkin scenario
assertions — keeping the demo graph separate from the test graphs means tweaking
the playground for tutorial clarity doesn't ripple into test failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

| ACID | Title | Status | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| req-gryphon-playground-fixtures-1 | Tier 1 Fixtures Isolated | Implemented | Each Tier 1 fixture seeds exactly one shape and is small enough to read in full. | |
| req-gryphon-playground-fixtures-2 | Tier 2 Playground Distinct | Proposed | The canonical playground fixture is not used by any Gridkin scenario's `background.grift_fixture` field. | Demo vs. test separation; the Tier-2 fixture is not built in v0 |
| req-gryphon-playground-fixtures-3 | Fixtures Validate As GRIFT | Implemented | Both tiers use the standard GRIFT format and pass standard GRIFT validation on load. | |

### Gridkin Format Specified Separately
----
RID: `req-gryphon-playground-gridkin`
Status: `Implemented`

The Gridkin scenario file format is governed by a companion spec, not by this one.

#### Implementation

The Gridkin scenario file format — the JSON shape of a `.gridkin.json` file, the
runner's discovery / loading / assertion contract, the oracle assertion
discipline, the snapshot regeneration discipline, the explain-SQL snapshot,
requirement traceability, the openCypher-TCK-as-inspiration workflow, and the
scenario-file JSON Schema — is specified in [spec-gridkin-v0.md](spec-gridkin-v0.md).

This plugin is the **home** of the Gridkin corpus; that spec is the **contract**
for the files in it. The split exists for two reasons:

1. The format has a plausible future as a public conformance contract for
   satellite query authors (per `project_satellite_system_vision`); keeping it in
   its own spec lets it evolve toward that independently of this plugin's
   internal structure.
2. A reader extending the *plugin* (new model, new fixture shape) and a reader
   extending the *format* (new scenario field, new assertion mode) are doing
   different work and benefit from different specs being authoritative.

#### Acceptance Criteria

| ACID | Title | Status | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| req-gryphon-playground-gridkin-1 | Format Spec Is Authoritative | Implemented | The Gridkin file format and runner contract are defined by `spec-gridkin-v0.md`; this spec does not restate them. | |
| req-gryphon-playground-gridkin-2 | Corpus Lives In Plugin | Implemented | All Gridkin scenario files, fixtures, expected side files, and the runner live under `plugins/gryphon_playground/`. | |
